# AES-Alternative-Ending-Story
This project is part of Codecademy's Learn C++ course.
## About
Through this project the use of conditional is intensive in order to give the reader of multiple ending accordingly with his/her choosing.

The story is based on the well-known european tale of The Little Red Riding Hood. It's origins are back to the 17th century and the best known versions were written by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm.

For the effects of this project the text is in spanish so if somebody would like to practice his/her spanish it could be of some benefit.
